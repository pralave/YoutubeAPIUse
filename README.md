# YoutubeAPIUse

Your program will allow the user to generate a YouTube query for:
• Top Rated
• Top Favorites
• Most Viewed

The user may specify the number of results they wish the query to be restricted by. Information
received from the query will be displayed on screen in a readable fashion. In addition to basic video
